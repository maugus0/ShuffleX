# ShuffleX
This is a package built in Golang that simulates playing around a deck of 52 cards. It has a lot of functions to simulate playing around with a deck of cards, like; newDeck, print, shuffle, deal, saveToDeck and newDeckFromFile. I have also written a couple of useful tests in Golang that check whether all the functions are working correctly or not.
