# ShuffleX
This is a package built in Golang that simulates playing around a deck of 52 cards. It has a lot of functions to simulate playing around with a deck of cards, like; newDeck, print, shuffle, deal, saveToDeck and newDeckFromFile. I have also written a couple of useful tests in Golang that check whether all the functions are working correctly or not.

You can use all functions defined in the file deck.go at main.go when you run ShuffleX.
